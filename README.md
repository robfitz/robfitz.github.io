## Tech
* jekyll with overwritten theme/styles
* github pages
* html boilerplate
* medium css (modified)

## Running locally

```
in windows powershell (or ideally non-windows anything):
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Deploy

It goes live once you push to master, so deploy is just:

```
git status -s
git add *
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin master
```
