title:  "Cofounders aren't mail order brides - you cant just \"find one\" once you're ready"

People always want to know "how to find a cofounder." This is a bad question which will deliver bad results. Part of the problem is in the phrasing. It's phrased like:

> "How do I find a nice hardwood table for my kitchen?" 
>
> "Oh, just go to this town on Sunday, they've got a great furniture market." 

The big failure is in the mindset behind the question, which treats "cofounder shopping" as a transactional experience, as if a cofounder was a mail order bride. 

Marriage is the right metaphor, partly due to the sharing of assets (your cofounder gets half-ish of your total earnings for the next 5-10 years, with high financial penalties if you break up) and partly due to the closeness of living and quantity of time spent together.

You (probably) wouldn't choose to marry someone until you had spent some time dating them. The qualities which stand out at first glance (height, income, attractiveness, how fun they are to drink with, etc.) aren't the same things we prioritize in a life partner (attitude toward adversity, the day-to-day experience of mundane life, kindness, empathy, etc.). Similarly, first impressions (whether from a cofounder dating event, job board, or wherever else) aren't sufficient (or even relevant) for choosing a cofounder. 

You would (probably) date several people before popping the question to one of them. We're well aware that we need to fumble through it a bit--with different types of people--before being able to recognize exactly who we're seeking.

Most of us will date lots of people in our lives and only end up marrying two or three of them. And we'll probably talk to several orders of magnitude more potential mates who we'll filter out before even deciding to go on a date with them. This "search for a spouse" isn't a discrete event that you add as a todo item once you decide you'd like to get married. You'd sound like a lunatic if you started telling your friends:

> "Hey, I've got a great idea for a house and a life and a family, and now all I need now is a wife. Do you know where I can find one?"

Replace the word 'wife' with 'cofounder' and you'll start to see the absurdity of the common mindset. Cofounders are not mail order brides. You can't "find" them transactionally. It's not something you do in a week upon deciding that you're ready to start a business. This is a ridiculous way to think about a decade-long, asset-sharing, legally binding, emotionally intense, and deeply trusting relationship.

Cofounders are a spouse. They're a life partner. As such, you "find" them in the same way you would "find" a loving and lovable husband or wife: by making the effort to date lots of potentially interesting people long before you ever expect to walk down the aisle. "Finding a cofounder" is not a discrete, one-off task; it's an ongoing background process that you're always willing to spend time on whenever someone intriguing enters your orbit.

The cofounder version of dating is the side project. The project can be of any size and variety , so long as it's a) collaborative and b) small enough that you can actually get it launched. The projects could be tech, but certainly don't need to be. Your project could involve running an event or co-authoring a blog or hacking together a prototype or getting into the fab lab and making something physical. Or hitting the pavement and doing some customer interviews. Whatever. As long as you're working together on a clear project, it works.

Side projects give early warning of a slew of otherwise company-killing problems. Is the person brilliant in theory but lackluster in practice? Are they angered to receive critical feedback and cruel in the way they give it? How do they roll with unexpected bumps and frustrations? Do they make progress or make excuses? Do they leave you feeling excited or drained? Do you both want to work at roughly the same intensity? Do you get excited about the same goals? Are you both great on your own but just don't work so well together?

I used to think you could sufficiently evaluate a cofounder through a series of heartfelt conversations at the pub. And it's true that there's some value to be found there. But on its own, heart-to-hearts are not enough. There's too much that can only be revealed by working on (and shipping) stuff together.

University students have an enormous (and underutilized) advantage since they're able to see the work created by hundreds of peers. They also benefit from a natural excuse to work on stuff together. Back in my uni days, Devin was undoubtedly the most talented student in my degree, so I sought him out as a teammate on future projects, leading to a working relationship, and then a friendship, and ultimately ten years' worth of companies. The key point is that we didn't begin as friends; we began as strangers and then became strangers who were working together on interesting projects. Based on the quality of his output, I made an effort to foster a potentially fruitful collaboration through the power of silly little projects.

Although it's a bit harder to set up outside those hallowed academic halls, side projects are still eminently doable. And the nice thing about the "real world" is that your side projects can earn you some pocket money. One of mine was a silly card game which we shipped via Kickstarter for about $60k revenue/$12k profit. The collaboration ended up being super stressful and ultimately convinced us that we did not want to work together on bigger stuff. That's a result.

I wound up working with Salim after attending a conference he had organized. I had been blown away by the quality of both the event and the individual, and I figured we might someday build interesting things together. But he had no idea who I was (just another random attendee) and we'd never spoken. So when the event ended and everyone left, I stuck around and helped the staff clean the venue and put away the chairs while striking up a conversation. In the end, I proactively stayed in touch for long enough until I found an opportunity to help him out on whatever he was doing next. By the time got around to starting a proper company, our little side projects had probably done something like $100k in revenue.

I've "dated" dozens of talented people in this way. Of those, there are about ten with whom I clicked strongly. A couple of those relationships immediately transitioned into actual businesses (like after I did a small joint research project with Tom), but most are simply idling as a potential future cofounder with whom I've already built the trust and confirmed alignment on values and worldview.

The types of people you'd want as a cofounder will tend to be talented and driven enough to have lots of their own stuff going on. They're going to have killer jobs and exciting lives and their own businesses and passions. So if you only know a single one of them, then they're likely to be unavailable when you need them. But if you've nurtured a number of these relationships over the years, then odds are a little bit better that one of them will be at a similar juncture in their journey, and you start to seem like a person who gets consistently lucky.
