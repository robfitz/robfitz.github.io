## <span id="1">1.</span> There are three types of partnerships:

1. **Mutually beneficial**: No legal protections, but you both do better (for now) by cooperating than by backstabbing
2. **Contractual**: You've added some legal penalties which make it more "expensive" to break up
3. **Swapping equity**: By swapping equity (of either your current companies or a new joint venture), you make it extremely difficult for either side to quit on the deal (but also add a ton of overhead and make it hard to get rid of a non-helpful partner)

You can think of them in terms of dating. A mutually beneficial partnership is like a casual hookup, which is "stable" insofar as both parties continue getting what they want and haven't found a better option elsewhere.

<p>Contractual is like moving in together, where it's a pain to leave (you lose some money on rent, have to buy a new fridge, get a moving van, etc), but you can still basically do it whenever if you're willing to soak up the costs.</p>

Equity partnerships are like getting married and buying a house together, but where you also know the house is probably going to burn down if you try to leave.

## <span id="2">2.</span> You should use the most casual type possible

Folks tend to want to skip straight to the more formal partnerships (contracts & equity). But you generally shouldn't. Why not, you ask?

In short, **before locking yourself in with legal overhead, you need to know whether the partner will actually deliver.** Most "partners" can't (or won't) do the job they've claimed they will do. This isn't due to incompetence, but rather due to indifference. This is partly because, for most companies, a new partnership is a nice-to-have. They'd be happy to see the extra 10% revenue (or whatever), but aren't willing to devote a huge amount of resource to it, since it's not their main thing. And it's also partly because people are wildly over-optimistic about how quickly a partnership will generate results, and also about how easy it will be to kick off. And then, a couple weeks down the road, when it's clearly going to be more of a pain than expected, resources get pulled and the project stalls.

If you're in a mutually beneficial partnership (no contract, no equity), then this is fine. You take the progress you've made, and get a head start trying again with a new partner. But if you got too excited ahead of time and set up a bunch of legals, you're now stuck doing all the work for half the prize (assuming it's even possible to get the project live without the partners' active support). In other words, "legal protections" are more like "legal restrictions", at least at the start, before you know whether your potential partner is able to deliver.

That being said, you still need to be clear on what you both expect to happen, so writing up a memo of understanding is certainly a good idea.

You wouldn't marry someone before you'd spent a little time dating them, right? Same concept applies. And in many cases, you never need to marry them. You can just keep it mutually beneficial (or contractual but non-equity) forever.

## <span id="3">3.</span> Before doing a big partnership, test it with a small one

Before launching some elaborate joint venture, ask yourselves if there's something smaller you could do, this week, just to get a feel for how you all ship stuff together. Can you do something, anything, to put the communication and collaboration to a real test? Can you do something to prove that the both parties can actually deliver?

Adding a partner is like simultaneously hiring a bunch of senior people (i.e. project leads and decision-makers) and trying to integrate them into your workflow, without being able to train or manage them. This works brilliantly when it works, because the partner becomes a meatspace API, magically returning results once you've finished your side of the work. But it's nearly impossible to fix when it doesn't work, and you want to be able to figure out which you're dealing with before you tie the knot.

In some cases, even a small test project can end up generating valuable assets (like new IP, branding, content, or a mailing list). My standard solution is a 1-page collaboration agreement specifying that you both have full, non-exclusive rights to all assets created by the collaboration (during the time you're both actively working on it), and that either of you can take any/all of those assets and do whatever they want with them (including launch a directly competing product without the partner). There are lots of these docs available online for you to modify. If the asset can't be duplicated (a URL is the only common example I can think of), then you just agree to burn it after the collaboration. Yes, this means the partner can "legally" cut you out. But if your contribution is so low value that it's profitable for them to move forward without you, then they would find a way to do it no matter what the contract said. As such, I don't see this as increasing the likelihood of that particular outcome. However, it does help the more common case that your partner totally flakes out, and you want to be able to continue the project without them (or with someone else).

Still, now that we're on the topic of being cut out...

<a href="#" class="small">&#8593; Up to Table of Contents</a>

## <span id="4">4.</span> Always assume your partner is actively working to cut you out

So you should start casual. But you must also be aware that the casual tiers of partnerships (i.e. anything below equity) are inherently unstable. Think of it like dating someone who is searching for Mr./Mrs. Right. They'll keep dating you for as long as you're their best option, but will bail the moment they find someone better.

In partnerships, folks don't generally bail because they found a better partner, but rather because they've decided to in-house whatever it is that you (used to) provide. They'll generally do this as secretly as possible, and will actively lie if pressed on it. Interestingly, this doesn't make them evil, but only rational. Because they have to assume that you're doing the same thing. And you will be, for the exact same reason they are. To do otherwise would be wildly financially irresponsible.

Now, in a perfect world, you'll both see the bigger picture, and can go on working happily together, and growing faster as a result of having less stuff to worry about. This is beautiful when it happens, and I'm not advising you to cut out your partners. Rather, I am advising you to prepare yourself to be cut out, so that if (when?) they do it, you can shrug it off and move on with your business. Out of all the people I've partnered with over the past ten years (lots), exactly one has seen the world like this, and we now share basically everything, business-wise, which is great for both of us. But sadly, most folks over-value what they're losing today (via partnership costs) instead of what it could bring them tomorrow (via growth), so they blow it up.

Non-equity partnerships are like a pirate ship: mutiny is averted not through any legal device, but simply because everyone agrees that the current arrangement is in all of their best interests. Under the right conditions, the crew can keep the peace for a long time. But it would be an irresponsible pirate captain indeed who didn't even consider a plan for how to prevent (or at least survive) an eventual, inevitable mutiny.

## <span id="5">5.</span> Stabilize valuable partnerships once they're proven

So the first two tiers of partnerships are inherently unstable. But that doesn't mean they're non-valuable. Think of them as an MVP for a new Business Model (or even just an optimisation to your existing one). The partnership lets you see "inside" a new Model within a matter of days instead of months. Plus, you're often generating profits from day 1. They're great.

But once you've stumbled across something valuable, you need to stabilize. You've got 3 options:

1. Cut out the partner and do it all yourself
2. Stay casual, but ensure you remain visibly beneficial
3. Formalise to the next tier (mutually beneficial → contract → equity)

The first point is already discussed, so we'll skip to the second.

How do you ensure you remain visibly beneficial? The answer will be very specific for your particular project, but I can give an antilog of what not to do. A nanny recently approached me, saying she had a brilliant idea for a children's book, and knew the perfect "partner" who could help her take it from idea to published (the partner was an established author of children's books, who had all the other necessary contacts). The nanny was asking how to avoid being cut out of the deal, after she had shared her brilliant idea with the author. I asked her what value she would be providing throughout the rest of the project, and she replied that there was literally nothing of ongoing value that she could provide. Well then... there's no partnership there. There's possibly a "deal" where she gets paid something in exchange for the idea, and then goes on her way. But certainly not an ongoing partnership. Still, perhaps she could find a way to make herself more relevant, if she thought creatively about it. For example, books benefit hugely from being tested by lots of early readers, but it's a pain to set up all those readings, gather the feedback, and so on. However, as a nanny, she has ongoing access to kids, and plenty of hours already with them. Perhaps her contribution to the partnership is as an ongoing source of live feedback. That probably wouldn't be enough value to get her 50%, but it might be enough to get her something.

Good reporting (to your partner) is also part of it. I once lost out on a great partnership because, although I was doing a fine job, I wasn't doing a good enough job of telling the partner what was happening on my end. While some partnerships are purely results-oriented (such as a mailing list + affiliate setup), many also depend on a feeling of "fairness" and the belief that both partners are putting in their fair share. Sending over a nice little report every week or two can go a long way toward ensuring they know that you're doing lots of valuable, difficult things.

The third option — formalising — is fairly self-explanatory. Formalising is totally fine if you both see value in the (already-running) partnership and want to (both) free yourselves from having to prepare for getting cut out. Just remember: equity is forever, which makes it a last resort. If you can secure the desired relationship with only a proper contract, then use that option first.

<a href="#" class="small">&#8593; Up to Table of Contents</a>

## <span id="6">6.</span> You might not be ready for partnerships, but you can work toward them

Although the nanny in the previous section wanted a partnership, she wasn't yet ready, because she didn't know how she was going to provide value. Upon encountering this obstacle, lots of new entrepreneurs will waste loads of time taking pointless partnership meetings, and then shake their fist at the heavens when someone "steals their idea" and does it without them. But like... what did they expect?

To make partnerships work (and you should, because they're free money), you need three things:

1. To deeply understand the partner's goals, fears, and current solutions (i.e. basic customer discovery stuff)
2. To be able to articulate the financial value of your contribution in those terms
3. To make it as easy for them as possible (not strictly required, but helpful)

Imagine a simple example where you have a product and the partner has a mailing list. The idea is to mash them together, promote to a new audience, and split the profits. To you, it's a no-brainer: free exposure, which you assume will turn into lots of sales. But the deal seems to stall and promotion never actually goes live. What's going on? What's happening here is that you don't properly understand the partner's goals, fears, and current solution. The partner already knows exactly what a product recommendation in his/her newsletter is worth, and their main goal is to maximise income from that recommendation (while still remaining relevant to their audience). So to close this partnership, you need to be able to give them a fairly accurate sense of the expected conversion rates for your product from this sort of promotion (and profit margin, if it varies). From your perspective, it feels like a "free" test. But from their perspective, it's not free at all (since they could be running an already-proven promotion, or even just going ad-free to boost their readers' goodwill). So to avoid endlessly spinning your wheels, you would need to find a way to get those numbers (without the partner's help), and then go back to them with a clear business case, in their own language. And if you aren't sure what your partner cares about and would want to see, then you need to spend some time chatting with them about that before you start blindly pitching something.

Making it easy is also important. Remember, for most other businesses, the partnership is a side-gig, not their main thing. The easier you can make it for them, the more likely it is to get started, prove its value, and grow from there. Your success rate will skyrocket if you can repeat the same type of deal multiple times to learn what works, and then boil it down to a simple checklist of tasks and deadlines that the partner needs to make good on. This isn't always possible in new, exploratory partnerships, but it's a good ideal to aim toward.

Different partners will have different fears and goals, of course. They'll need different data and different assurances that you're able to deliver. So if it might be important to you, you can start gathering that information in an intentional way now, so that you're ready to quickly succeed at partner projects later.

## <span id="7">7.</span> Pick partners who are at roughly the same stage as you

While you're still getting started, "partnerships" with gigantic companies are usually a trap, and I'd suggest avoiding them. Big companies are overly conservative about brand and legal risk, which makes them lawyer-heavy and hugely slow. Your partnership is also vanishingly unimportant to them. They're already doing $10 billion (or whatever) per year in revenue. Even if you can guarantee them tens of millions in a matter of days, they literally do not care in the slightest. That sort of result won't even appear on their radar. In these cases, the "partner" is typically just interested in a PR story which shows them doing something "innovative", which means you're approximately as important to them as a blog post. This is tedious in the best of cases, and absolute suicide if you're betting your business on it.

Instead, pick early partners who are at roughly the same stage as you. For example, if you're earning $500k / year, then you can easily have a credible conversation with partners who are doing somewhere between $200k and $1m. You'll both take each other seriously, and more importantly, you'll both care about the potential upside of the partnership in roughly the same way, which means you'll both be equally motivated to kick it down the field. Financials are one way to approximate your "stage", but you aren't always trading like-for-like. For example, you might consider your revenue to be roughly "equal" to someone else's audience, or a third person's reputation, or a fourth person's IP. Most partnerships die during either never-ending negotiations or disinterested product development. This means that your main goal for early partnerships is for them to actually launch. And you'll have the most success at that if you're targeting partners who are in more or less the same place as you.

I'm not saying you can't get lucky with a big company. Occasionally they'll run a CEO-driven initiative to partner with a bunch of small companies as quickly as possible, for some clearly defined strategic goal, and backed by a large amount of dedicated resources. (A bank in the UK did this a couple years ago, essentially making their banking license, insurance, and legal team available to any fintech startups who wanted to try something wacky). That's a windfall, and you're obviously free to take advantage. But it's extremely rare. In the normal case, however, struggling to set up partnerships with someone much larger than yourself is just going to hurt you. Better to keep your head down, team up with folks on roughly your level, and work together to get into the big leagues properly. You (probably) wouldn't try to recruit someone like Richard Branson as your cofounder for your first startup. Even if he humoured you by taking the meeting, it likely wouldn't go anywhere. Instead, if you want to someday work with someone like Branson, you would team up with some cofounders at more or less the same level as yourself, and then work together to level up. Same concept. You can possibly team up with someone who is 5-10x ahead, but not much more than that.

(Once you've run a couple successful partnerships, feel free to ignore the advice in this particular section. Each company is unique, and it's possible that you can skip some steps once you know exactly what you're offering.)

## <span id="8">8.</span> Closing notes & how to avoid getting screwed
A few of the ways of getting screwed:

- Wasting time proposing a partnership without understanding the partners' goals or without having enough clarity on exactly what you're offering. (Fix it by running good "customer discovery" conversations on your partners, and running your own internal tests to gather key metrics.)
- Going with a heavy contract/equity partnership from the very beginning, wasting time on overkill negotiations and potentially ending up with a dead-weight partner you can't get rid of. (Fix it by starting with a casual, mutually beneficial, quick trial project.)
- Proposing a cool idea to a partner who can do everything themselves, and then getting cut out immediately. (Fix it by finding a way to add legitimate ongoing value, or by just taking a small one-time payment instead of trying to create a long-term partnership.)
- Creating a successful partnership only to get cut out when the partner decides to in-house the activity you used to provide (Fix it by stabilising the partnership via either formalising toward contracts/equity, or by also moving to replace them so that you can keep running when they bail.)
- Wasting time haggling with huge companies who don't actually care about what you can offer. (Fix it by picking partners at roughly your level.)

I was asked on a podcast recently what I would do if I needed to make money in a hurry. I answered that it would depend on how much I needed. For £10k, I would freelance (teaching workshops, since that's higher-earning for me than programming). For £100k, I would try to set up a couple partnerships (probably events/workshops again, since I know them well). For £1m, I would start a bootstrapped, cashflow positive small business (probably still making heavy use of partnerships). For £10m+, there's really no choice except to go back to scalable (funded) startups. These options all obviously have different trade-offs and success rates, but partnerships play an important role in filling the gap between going fully solo (i.e. freelance) and putting in all the overhead to build an organisation that can do everything itself.
