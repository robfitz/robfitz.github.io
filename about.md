    <h2>About Rob Fitzpatrick</h2>
    <p>
    Hello. I'm a techie who got hooked on startups after going through YC back in summer '07, where we were trying to figure out social and user-generated advertising. We raised funding from great investors and worked with a few big customers like Sony and MTV, although ultimately couldn't make it work (due largely to my own failings on the custdev and sales side of things).</p>
    <p>
    Upon finding myself fairly broke in the aftermath of that first failure, I built a string of survival businesses to keep the wolf from the door, including some edtech, a kickstarted card game, a coworking space, various freelance careers, an education agency, a couple joint ventures, and plenty of software. All in all, I've been running little businesses and building products for 13 years now.</p>   
    <p>
    Meanwhile, after finally figuring out what I was doing wrong while talking to customers, I wrote <a href="http://momtestbook.com">The Mom Test</a>, a now-classic handbook about the practical side of Customer Development that is taught at most top accelerators and universities (YC, Seedcamp, Tech Stars, Harvard, MIT, UCL, etc). I've also written books about education design (<a href="https://workshopsurvival.com">The Workshop Survival Guide</a>) and treating books as problem-solving products (<a href="https://writeusefulbooks.com">Write Useful Books</a>).</p>
    <p>
    After taking a couple years off to learn to sail, restore an old sailboat, and travelling with it from London to the Med, I'm now settled in the mountains of Catalonia, northwest of Barcelona. I'm helping to run a small, profitable publishing business that both manages my books and builds software to help other indie authors have an easier time of it.</p>

## About this site

I started blogging back in 2010 as a way to try and process (and share) what was happening during the slow, grinding failure of my first business. Several years and <a href="http://thestartuptoolkit.com/blog/series-and-topics/" target="_blank">200ish articles</a> later, I felt like I'd mostly wrapped my head around it. Meanwhile, that first blog's <em>other</em> mission--to document and share the emerging best practices in early stage entrepreneurship--had been well and truly <a href="https://playbook.samaltman.com/" target="_blank">sorted</a> by the community. As such, I paused it to focus on other stuff.

Several years on, I now feel like I'm holding some fresh perspectives and experiences worth sharing. On this site (and in this newsletter) I'm going to be sharing the occasional new thought, mostly about either building better products or writing better books.

I'll try to avoid writing stuff that's already been well-handled by someone else. If you'd like to follow along, you may do so <a href="/subscribe">either monthly or quarterly</a>.
