## About this site

Following the slow, grinding failure of my first business in 2010, I started blogging as a way to try and understand (and share) what had gone so wrong. Several years and <a href="http://thestartuptoolkit.com/blog/series-and-topics/" target="_blank">200ish</a> articles later, I felt like I had a decent grip on it, and that its other mission--to document and share the emerging best practices in early-stage entrepreneurship--had been well and truly <a href="https://playbook.samaltman.com/" target="_blank">sorted</a> by the community. As such, I paused it to focus instead on writing books, teaching workshops, living life, and building whatever seemed fun. 

But now, several years on, I feel like I'm holding some fresh perspectives and experiences worth sharing. During my blogging hiatus I have: built a pair of bootstrapped-and-profitable small businesses; reached financial independence via passive income; seen my <a href="http://geni.us/momtest" target="_blank">first book</a> get picked up as a text at Harvard, MIT, and elsewhere; and worked closely with a bunch of entrepreneurs and large companies on how to apply this stuff in ways that I haven't seen written or talked about elsewhere. I've also had my ass kicked repeatedly in areas I thought I had totally under control, so hopefully that helps maintain some perspective ;)

Although some of my companies have been scalable startups, I've been surprised by how much I've also enjoyed working on smaller, less scalable, more lifestyle-focused businesses. I'll write about both, but my interest is mainly on using startups as a path toward a good life as opposed to sacrificing life in pursuit of a good startup.
